Monday: Build out the html and css for a bus mall. Similar to the sky mall but for seattle buses. we will be using a focus group to pre-determine what products to put in the catalogue. As such, the focus group will be presented with images of products and voting on these products. 

Tuesday: Refactoring code. Fixing the random image selector, there's a bug in the functions ability to repick a picture if it's been recently picked. Generate a chart based on the vote tally for the pictures.
